                It is important to ensure that Phil gets tea regularly. Without this regular supply he gets cranky and his work becomes erratic and unreliable. <br />
                <span class="italic">(He will be cranky, erratic and unreliable anyway, but that's no reason to risk withholding tea.)</span>

            <p>
                The task is best done by filling a good-quality mug with freshly-brewed English Breakfast tea<sup>1</sup> with a little milk.

                On occasions when that is not possible cardboard tea is acceptable.<br />
